[music]

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,150
I would like to ask you a question

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,070
whether you trust your laptop, your phone

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,080
or the smart TV that

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,000
you have at home, I think everyone in the

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,100
audience understands that

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,800
technology is increasingly penetrating

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,869
our lives, no one is surprised by the fact that

9
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,340
after work we can  turn on

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,340
food in the microwave for heating, that

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,950
cameras are watching us everywhere and analyzing our

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,200
actions, that our children are already playing

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,700
smart toys that are connected to

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,500
Wi-Fi, which transmit some data

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,899
to various servers, but do we worry

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,050
about this data if we have fears and what

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,930
if hackers attack our country and

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,670
take over our online media and

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,440
government sites, who should we

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,930
believe and that these fears remain

21
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,530
believe and that these fears remain

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,079
fears so that we live in some kind

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,140
of confidence that we are not being

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,600
deceived that we are not being watched, every

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,060
state should monitor  for its

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,250
cyber security should nurture

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,840
its own hackers who will protect

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,330
their state and Kazakhstan in this  no

29
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,270
exception, let's go back to the present,

30
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,900
that is, you read the news on the net and the

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,159
latest headlines are full of the fact

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,189
that the United States accuses Russia of cyber aggression

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,390
that China has already put

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,909
our industrial tibbers on stream that even

35
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,009
let's say so North Korea, which

36
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,570
would seem to be in isolation to the

37
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,930
technological  of progress, they already say

38
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,840
what exactly it produced, the land was attacked,

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,460
yes, you probably heard a lot about it,

40
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,259
which because of which the world suffered

41
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,619
billions of dollars in losses, and I want to tell you

42
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,690
in general who hackers are,

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,120
how they affect progress, why

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,910
Kazakhstan should build some kind of its own

45
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,550
defense to a cyber shield and  can we become

46
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,740
that country of correct hackers who

47
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,259
where we will live confidently and feel

48
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,040
safe, let's start with the first

49
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,840
question of who are hackers, that is, the world

50
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,280
we share good and evil

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,560
yin-yang black and white and the hacker

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,300
world, that is, there is the so-called  black

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,220
hacker white hacker that is, but they are

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,870
called by a different name, they are black hats and

55
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,790
white bread  that is, black hats, those

56
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,430
who are engaged in hacking for some kind of

57
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,380
profit, that is, there is blackmail for the sake of and

58
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,030
money has grown from your cards

59
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,340
for the sake of massive attacks, and so on, I think

60
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,470
many of you have come across this, but since

61
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,540
there is a black hacker, there is a natural

62
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,580
white hacker  white hats, that is, these are the

63
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,050
guys who are engaged in hacking,

64
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,880
find for the sake of some kind of self-affirmation,

65
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,590
curiosity, that is, after they

66
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,180
find a vulnerability somewhere, they

67
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,300
report it to the owner of the systems, and usually

68
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,210
these people wanted and help countries to complete

69
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,880
their protection, but in addition to these two

70
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,970
groups, there are  there are also other types of

71
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,220
hackers, that is, the same hacktivists,

72
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,840
you probably all heard about anonymous oh

73
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,459
yes, that is, even though vista are those who

74
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,110
hack for the sake of some idea of their own, that is, f

75
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,670
r the sake of freedom of speech for the sake of freedom of the Inter

76
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,830
et, then

77
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,989
here are the so-called violin dice for

78
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,390
this may be an unfamiliar word for you, you

79
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,280
all hackers think that these are just words

80
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,690
hacker violin dice these are those who themselves do not

81
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,610
write viruses themselves do not  they develop ryan

82
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,680
and they just buy it on various

83
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,269
forums before using some other people's

84
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,090
work, but it is they who steal your

85
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,340
social accounts on instagram

86
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,980
it is they who encrypt your computers

87
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,769
it is they who steal money from you, that is,

88
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,450
so that you understand

89
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,430
that a low-skilled simple

90
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,930
hacker is acting against you  that is, they are not real hackers yet,

91
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,750
there are so-called cyber

92
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,370
terrorists, that is, the last trend

93
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,050
is especially relevant in the Middle

94
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,620
East,

95
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,320
many traveler's checks are sponsored, that

96
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,019
is, such cyber groups have

97
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:58,030
unlimited budgets and they will hack

98
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,160
for the sake of some idea of their own, yes, there is polit

99
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,569
cal, religious and

100
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:04,540
Kazakhstan  unfortunately, it’s no exception, that

101
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,819
is, we fix hacks every day and

102
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,689
these hackers replace the main page and

103
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,650
publish some extremist

104
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,200
calls there, thereby they spread

105
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,870
their ideas and the last type

106
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,250
that we’ll talk about today is in

107
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,779
English called sponsors

108
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,570
hackers of those same cyber  troops  who

109
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,039
have unlimited budgets and

110
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,919
unlimited opportunities now we live at

111
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,220
a time when the one who controls

112
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,960
cyberspace will also control

113
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,300
our world, and therefore I now want to

114
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,370
tell you how I actually came to this myself

115
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,910
why I got carried away with hacking it all

116
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,949
starts here starts with a passion for

117
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,720
computer games to sit there  on the

118
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,190
Internet how can you do it for free

119
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,979
everything further is already interesting

120
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,419
programming yes how to write your own

121
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,729
game there how to write a small

122
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:53,949
program to distinguish the guys here

123
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:55,330
then everything smoothly goes to the

124
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,930
olympiads and after that it seems to me

125
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,780
that the line is going, that is, either you just

126
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,460
go there  on the path of a programmer on the path of a

127
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,530
system administrator yes, that is,

128
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,630
as long as you are trunks or you go

129
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,460
deeper, that is, you are curious you are

130
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,020
curious how another program works

131
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,180
you are curious what if you

132
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,030
insert another parameter here as

133
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,729
another developer thought

134
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:19,830
there how to hack your

135
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,289
school teacher's computer  yes and there  to

136
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,360
place some kind of not beautiful picture there, yes,

137
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,219
well, most likely it’s vulgar this childhood

138
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:28,889
, we usually posted it to you, but

139
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,629
let’s say it would seem that some kind of

140
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:32,370
harmless such jokes turn into

141
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,759
some kind of income, and now the hacker

142
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,349
becomes one of the first VKontakte

143
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,339
spammers because  that vkontakte then

144
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,180
had weak filters,

145
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,680
so you could safely

146
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,919
distribute rubber there a message and

147
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,569
now hacked Pavel Durov himself

148
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:51,389
because they didn’t check the code of your

149
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:53,550
game, by the way, on the world, many of you

150
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,800
played the farm before vkontakte, so

151
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,509
you know through such popular games a

152
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,879
hacker  hijacked a million accounts and

153
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,680
read a million rewritten and

154
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:07,169
that is, you want to go to the

155
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:08,669
next step and you and your

156
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,740
friend slider launch

157
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,169
a worm on mail.ru there that gives

158
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,789
you access to a million mail

159
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:19,020
accounts there and you can read it all

160
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,449
any here and  yes, and you are already here,

161
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,919
youthful maximalism comes to you, you

162
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,930
feel like a god, you understand

163
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,550
that you can do it there  something to control

164
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,969
some kind of interaction there 2 me

165
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,729
other people with other people and so

166
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:37,289
on and just at this moment and a person

167
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,959
chooses to that side, that is, one thing and

168
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,189
you do it for the sake of curiosity

169
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,069
for the sake of some kind of self-assertion and

170
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:45,689
then you report it to the owner about

171
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:47,430
this appearance that he fixed another

172
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,479
thing when you cross this line and

173
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,639
it becomes a blockhead theme black hats and

174
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,680
when you start extorting money when

175
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,809
you start stealing money from these people

176
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:58,680
and

177
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,029
you turn here maybe you

178
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:02,069
heard the words carter yes there  these are those

179
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:04,469
who just withdraw money from your cards

180
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:08,520
and hacking is primarily

181
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,979
curiosity, that is, what if I

182
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,790
do this, yes, and what if I

183
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,410
do it differently than the program was

184
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,900
calculated and in fact there is 1 hacker,

185
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,070
it was not those who  he cracked the

186
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,530
source code it was the first though and they

187
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,150
were social engineers i.e. they

188
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,000
found gaps in people's communications in people's

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,180
actions i.e. made it so

190
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,639
that he  it would have told you some information

191
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,960
when hackers started and this is how it

192
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,960
started and these young people are the

193
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,699
future and become who shot down and at least

194
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,199
once they become the very cyber

195
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,120
troops such were the defenders who

196
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,610
help their state build a

197
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,770
secure

198
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,660
infrastructure and now I want it  using the example of

199
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,180
two countries, here is the first country, this is

200
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,960
Israel, you all know that Israel has a

201
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,070
national idea, yes, this is

202
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,949
security, but few people know that Israel

203
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,380
is one of the main suppliers of

204
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,090
cyber weapons, that is, virus trojans,

205
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,139
an interception system for such

206
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,360
your calls, that is, you will not have time  fly to

207
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,669
them at the airport they monitor all

208
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,120
your social networks do who you

209
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,919
communicate with if you are in the dark net

210
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,139
yes if your passwords in the dark net are there from

211
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,660
your mail I saw these systems they

212
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,979
cost a million dollars and they are

213
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,479
really impressive, that is, they

214
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,490
work more than  100 investigators who

215
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,260
every day try to find the use of the suits of

216
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,570
your phones, then in this operation

217
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,159
system and besides that, they also

218
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,950
monitor the entire Internet for new such

219
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,409
ultrasound suits, buy them and add them to

220
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,970
their cyber weapon, that is, they understand

221
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,730
that

222
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,490
cyber attacks are the weapon of the future next

223
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,640
I would like to tell about the usa everyone must

224
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,730
have heard about the wikileaks leak

225
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,680
published was a cyber weapon leak

226
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,620
nbc  ru that is, it was probably the

227
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,900
biggest gift for hackers, some hackers

228
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,760
stole from other hackers and published

229
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,790
something on the net and what you can see here is

230
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,970
interesting, that is,

231
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,950
more than eight thousand documents were shown there that

232
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,750
explain how to hack this or that,

233
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,170
you can see there an

234
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,750
uzi suit magician  android here you are all the numbers

235
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,160
trust your antivirus but you should

236
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,959
know that you are in the middle of the name of

237
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,790
all popular antiviruses, that is, they

238
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,560
all bypass, that is, the same one on the

239
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,570
edge did bypass the antivirus, that is, it

240
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,950
will not be difficult for a hacker to bypass your antivirus,

241
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,480
so do not rely on it  something else is

242
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,100
interesting, I told you if you are not afraid

243
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,839
that your body is watching you  visor and

244
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,570
here in the upper left corner you can even

245
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,519
see the brand name of the TV before the

246
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,010
samsung g80 smart tivi,

247
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,529
so they had instructions on how

248
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,019
you can

249
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,829
even turn off the TV and

250
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:53,480
turn on the camera so that they don’t notice it and

251
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,130
listen to everything around your

252
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,430
space so  girls be

253
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,050
careful when you go half-naked to

254
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:07,040
cover but we like it here in

255
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,209
the lower right corner

256
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,240
you see 2048 mayor everyone played it yes I

257
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,720
didn’t play it either so you know how the

258
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,470
special services would develop special

259
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,050
games like this 2840 it’s 2048 which were

260
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,940
substituted and which got access to

261
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,970
your  phone, you understand that if a

262
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,320
person gets access to your phone, this is

263
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,579
all your correspondence, all your

264
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:29,420
location,

265
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,740
all that you do, that is, this is all your

266
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,839
personal life, it is always impressive that

267
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,610
billions of dollars have been spent on this and you

268
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,410
see what potential and that's one

269
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,970
hope you after that  also stand and

270
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,510
paranoid yet I

271
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,680
cyber attacks have already become the ideal

272
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,269
tool of current wars t  oh, they are

273
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:48,949
swift and effective in their

274
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,959
destructiveness, as a rule,

275
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,519
unfortunately they are anonymous, that is, you don’t

276
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,440
know where the attack comes from, that is,

277
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,510
hackers how to do it, they can set up

278
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,190
servers in another country and through

279
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,550
them and now cyber weapons are

280
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,779
equated with weapons of mass

281
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,610
destruction  that is, he equated it with a

282
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,350
gun mass defeat let's move on

283
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,040
shooting range Kazakhstan

284
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,459
yes what is the situation we have here we have a growing

285
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:12,560
rating of e-government

286
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,660
we all use both heads and z and so on

287
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,819
we

288
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:19,189
are building a start-up incubator there we

289
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:21,139
even have a vice prime minister  to

290
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,549
which is responsible to go in each

291
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,379
ministry there is a supervisor yes it seems

292
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:25,910
everything is fine but do you think we

293
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,660
are absolutely not safe there is such a

294
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,459
world rating called the cyber

295
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,169
readiness index it is compiled by the international

296
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,619
telecommunications institute and unfortunately we are in

297
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,720
this yandex in eighty-third

298
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,600
place yandex shows whether we are ready  we are

299
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,059
either not ready for cyber attacks unfortunately we are

300
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,919
absolutely  I’m not ready now, I want to

301
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,119
show you two cases of

302
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:50,419
our research from the technical details

303
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,959
that you yourself assessed what level of

304
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,399
cyber defense we have two years ago at one

305
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,879
of our conferences we demonstrated a

306
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,779
study it was a practical one at that

307
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:03,889
stage theoretically this is really

308
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,709
practical things we showed with the help of an

309
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,350
experiment how to  5 minutes you can

310
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,899
turn off the entire domain zone shop behind that

311
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,850
look we have a domain registrar system

312
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,410
the forging zone for this what does it mean

313
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,959
this is a system that manages all the

314
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,419
addresses of state institutions and

315
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:23,389
woof there the akimat court and so on, that

316
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:24,949
is, when you go through the sites you saw a

317
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:25,729
blouse  cue for

318
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:28,309
here there is a single system, unfortunately there

319
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:31,129
was a very childish use suit there, I

320
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:33,279
will not go into technical details

321
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,479
through which it was possible to

322
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,549
enter the system in five minutes, we will answer and

323
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,489
under the administrator, and here I am

324
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:42,199
only one click away from

325
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:45,109
deleting  ligovka z domain, that

326
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:45,799
is,

327
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,749
can you imagine these  all six, about six hundred

328
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,519
domains, if I could sleep, it would be possible to delete them,

329
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,519
and in order to restore all this, it

330
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,869
would probably take a

331
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:55,579
week, and that is, we would have a complete

332
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:56,749
black-out, that is, we would have

333
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:59,869
customs, the courts of schools and hospitals would

334
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:01,339
grow because everything  the second case is going through the

335
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,279
electronic government,

336
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,350
you may have recently

337
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,359
heard this, a month ago there was a noise about

338
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:10,819
the document management system, we published about it

339
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:12,829
, that is, so that you would have his

340
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,479
brother’s document system, this system that

341
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,639
goes through all orders, all correspondence and where

342
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,989
state bodies, that is, they are

343
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:20,029
used by ministries such attacks

344
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,039
so on and unfortunately there were

345
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:25,459
winters in that by sending just a girl and a

346
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,570
support service a

347
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,130
certain letter, you could get

348
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,540
access to the administration system and

349
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,030
get access to all the documents of

350
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,090
Constance government agencies, and that’s the saddest thing that

351
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,590
''

352
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,360
our employee who is studying in the second

353
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,220
year found this appearance  and Almaty University, that is,

354
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,260
it is not some kind of cyber in  oyska yes, that

355
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,200
is, you understand, it’s just an employee and he

356
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,820
could attack on the black market, that is, he

357
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,570
told us and so we reacted like this, but is

358
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,400
everything so bad, that is, can we

359
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,800
make you become one of the world’s

360
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,180
powers, that is, we have many

361
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,800
officials here  and the predators say that we

362
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,860
should become how to follow the path of india

363
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,570
china to nurture thousands of

364
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,760
programmers there and outsource everything but

365
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,770
let's admit that we will not be able to

366
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,030
compete there with millions of

367
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,190
programmers from india and china it's pretty

368
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,010
hard we have not such a large population

369
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,550
but what are we  we can do we can reach

370
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,200
our own hackers and it doesn’t need

371
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,790
so much that is, it doesn’t need to be done

372
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,910
for a million, we will have enough at least to

373
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,900
raise this one, if at least 100

374
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,790
people, that is, that person is enough

375
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,650
even if you look at India has millions of

376
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,930
programmers but  in the hacker field, let's say,

377
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,630
they are rather weak, we just

378
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,820
can fill a niche, especially since we

379
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,250
have a good potential in Kazakhstan, that

380
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,510
is, we have a good  we have a mathematical school

381
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,700
that is developing everywhere, and those

382
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,530
industries are so stormy, and now we

383
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,690
even brought cybersport to our academy,

384
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,820
and on the wave of this whole hype, we can

385
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,210
object to these people and

386
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,770
you can look at this slide in this

387
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,570
photo, one of the strongest hacker teams in the

388
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,670
central  asia i want to be sent this is

389
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,600
our team few of you know but this

390
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,880
team has been taking first

391
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,200
place at the international hacker

392
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,460
conference for two years now thanks for clapping

393
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,410
i.e. we are more known abroad than in

394
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,280
kazakhstan we are filmed there and the diode and

395
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,720
i.e. there are two-day

396
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,000
competitions there cyber  a training ground where an

397
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,980
imitation of a smart city is located where a

398
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,180
nuclear power plant stands there this is a smart

399
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,250
traffic light Internet banking and more than 10 and

400
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,420
hacker teams from all over the world

401
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,170
compete with each other and from who

402
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,290
will advance further talking about the potential I

403
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,830
’m saying that we have these guys here

404
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,720
they are not so  a lot and as you can see it's not

405
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,760
those nerds in thick glasses as they

406
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,830
used to see boats, that is, this

407
00:15:52,830 --> 00:16:03,330
it looks pretty nice, but

408
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,480
unfortunately there are not enough of these people, that is, even

409
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,350
the guys want to go abroad everywhere and they

410
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,030
understand that they don’t go because they don’t

411
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,500
understand

412
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,110
that they are making history in Kazakhstan because they are trying to make call

413
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,270
astana one of those world cyber powers

414
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,030
to move their own  some kind of

415
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,240
research victories

416
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,520
what we should do I like the

417
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,870
expression

418
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,450
dear fuad bey you know him

419
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,130
who moved the spots to program in

420
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,170
Kazakhstan and he always says the battle

421
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,400
is for 1 person,

422
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,590
that is, we should look for those cyber

423
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,300
geniuses who have been fond of hacking since childhood from school

424
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,860
and  you have

425
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,270
to put them on the right path, that is, we

426
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,230
should not nurture thousands of

427
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,490
programmers there, we should find

428
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,850
precisely these talents who just need to find a

429
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,680
new generation that will replace these

430
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,290
guys and there will be more of them who

431
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,390
will be engaged in what will be built on

432
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,760
zhki drischet because boiling  you are not a

433
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,980
firewall, this is not a server, yes, these are people, these are

434
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,270
people who  they will defend, I want to say

435
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,700
that we are not a nuclear power yes we

436
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,890
have a very small population we have a

437
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,200
very small army part we are not at war

438
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,150
with our neighbors for a long time everyone in the world loved

439
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,819
but unfortunately cyber attacks can

440
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,500
come to us from any end

441
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,470
of the globe and they are already underway  we must

442
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,770
already be ready for this

443
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,930
and in order for us to live in peace we

444
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,820
must just find these people we

445
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,770
must support these people and they

446
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,680
will ensure our safety

447
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,960
thank you

448
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,180
